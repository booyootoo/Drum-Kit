# 🥁 Drum Kit 📚

This is a drum kit in Javascript. It was created using the training https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

Here you learned to play audio and get the user input from a key.
It also shows how to do add event listeners and gave the first introduction to 
constructors.
